"That’s where sharing the web comes in: users with access to content or a "
"stable network help to collect and share content with those who don’t. This "
"means, for example, that a Ceno user in Azerbaijan can read a blocked "
"article if another Ceno user in Italy has pulled up the same one. This is "
"made possible by people running Ceno from countries with more reliable and "
"open access to the internet – we call these users “Bridges”. Bridges can "
"share content with people using Ceno in heavily restricted networks."
