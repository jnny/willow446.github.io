"Ceno has two modes of operation - Public and Personal. You can easily toggle "
"between them. Public mode offers the best connectivity but the least privacy "
"- websites that you visit or share are recorded in a publicly-accessible "
"registry (BitTorrent). Personal mode eliminates this record but may be "
"slower and less efficient at retrieving content. See <a href=\"faq.html\""
">the FAQ</a> or <a href=\"../user-manual\">User Manual</a> for more details "
